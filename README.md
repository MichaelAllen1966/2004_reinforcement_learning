## Set up environment locally

To get the correct libraries and versions it is recommended that the provided conda environment is used. To create and activate a rl_examples environment:

1. Windows -> Open Anaconda prompt. Mac/linux -> Open a terminal

2. Navigate to the ./binder directory

3. Run the following command: conda env create -f environment.yml

This will fetch and install the libraries in a conda environment 'rl_examples'

4. To activate the bootcomp enviroment run the following command:
    conda activate rl_examples
